name: interview-me
description: Extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want. Achieves this through one-question-at-a-time interview until ~95% confidence about the underlying intent. Use when an ask is underspecified ("build me X" without "for whom" or "why now"), when the user explicitly invokes ("interview me", "grill me", "are we sure?", "stress-test my thinking"), or when you catch yourself silently filling in ambiguous requirements before any plan, spec, or code exists.

# Interview Me

## Overview

What people ask for and what they actually want are different things. They ask for "a dashboard" because that's what one asks for, not because a dashboard solves their problem. They say "make it faster" without a number to hit.

The cheapest moment to find this gap is before any plan, spec, or code exists. Once you've started building, switching costs are real, and the user will rationalize the wrong thing into a "good enough" thing. The misfit gets locked in.

This skill closes the gap before it costs anything. The downstream skills assume you already know roughly what you want: `task-scope-and-spec` pins down the requirements, `planning-and-task-decomposition` orders them, and `goal-workflow` or `guided-implementation` builds them. Interview-me is the part before all of those, where you ask one question at a time, with your best guess attached, until you can predict what the user is going to say before they say it.

## When to Use

Apply this skill when:

- The ask is missing at least one of: **who** the user is, **why** they want it, what **success** looks like, what the binding **constraint** is
- The request is conventional rather than specific ("build me X", "make it faster") and you can't unpack the convention without guessing
- You're tempted to start with assumptions you haven't surfaced
- The user hasn't said which value they're optimizing for when two reasonable ones are in tension (simplicity vs. flexibility, cost vs. speed)
- The user explicitly invokes: "interview me", "grill me", "before we start, are we sure?", "stress-test my thinking"

**When NOT to use:**

- The ask is unambiguous and self-contained ("rename this variable", "fix this typo")
- The user has explicitly asked for speed over verification
- Pure information requests ("how does X work?", "what does this code do?")
- Mechanical operations (renames, formats, file moves)
- You already have ≥95% confidence; re-read the stop condition below before assuming you don't

## Loading Constraints

This skill needs a live, responsive user. **Do not invoke in non-interactive contexts** like CI pipelines, scheduled runs, `/loop`, or autonomous-loop. If you're in one of those and the ask is underspecified, flag that as a blocker for the user instead of guessing.

## The Process

### Step 1: Hypothesize, with a confidence number

Before asking anything, write down your current best read of what the user wants in **one sentence**, plus an honest confidence number (0–100%):

```
HYPOTHESIS: You want a way to answer "how are we doing?" in standup, and "dashboard" was the convention that came to mind.
CONFIDENCE: ~30% — missing: who it's for, what "metrics" means in context, and what success looks like
```

The number forces honesty. If you wrote down a high number but can't actually predict the user's reactions to the next three questions you'd ask, the number is wrong. Start at the confidence level you can defend.

When confidence is below ~70%, append a brief reason on the same line — what's still unresolved or missing. This tells the user exactly what the interview needs to surface, and prevents the number from being a vague signal.

### Step 2: Ask one question at a time, each with a guess attached

Format:

```
Q: <one focused question>
GUESS: <your hypothesis for the answer, with the reasoning that produced it>
```

Wait for the user to react before asking the next question.

Batching buries your hypotheses, invites skim-reading, and locks in a framing before the first answer can change it. The guess matters because reacting is faster than generating from scratch, and it exposes *your* assumptions — which is the point of the exercise.

The risk is a polite user agreeing to be agreeable. Mitigate by being visibly willing to be wrong, and occasionally guess where you expect pushback.

### Step 3: Listen for "want vs. should want"

The most dangerous answers sound like a thoughtful answer rather than a true one. Watch for best-practice talk without specifics ("scalable", "clean architecture"), deference to convention ("the standard approach"), and "I should probably…".

When you hear one, ask:

> *"If you didn't have to justify this to anyone, what would you actually want?"*

That single question often does more work than the previous five.

### Step 4: Restate intent in the user's own words

When your confidence is high, write back what you now think the user wants. Keep it tight (5–8 lines), use their language where possible, and structure it so the user can confirm or correct line by line:

```
Here's what I now think you want:

- Outcome:      <one line>
- User:         <one line — who benefits>
- Why now:      <one line — what changed>
- Success:      <one line — how we know it worked>
- Constraint:   <one line — the binding limit>
- Out of scope: <one line — what we're explicitly not doing>

Yes / no / refine?
```

Including "Out of scope" is non-negotiable. Half of misalignment is silent disagreement about what is *not* being built.

### Step 5: Confirm — explicit yes, not "whatever you think"

The gate is an explicit "yes." The following are **not** yes:

- "Whatever you think is best." → The user is delegating, which means they don't have 95% confidence either. Re-ask with two concrete options framed as a choice.
- "Sounds good." → Ambiguous. Ask: "Anything you'd refine?" Silence isn't confirmation.
- "Sure, let's go." → Often a polite exit, not an endorsement. Same follow-up.
- Silence followed by "okay let's start." → The user has given up on the interview, not converged. Stop and ask whether you've missed something.

If they correct you, fold the correction in and restate. Loop until you get an explicit yes.

### The 95% Confidence Stop

You're done when you can answer yes to this:

> *Can I predict the user's reaction to the next three questions I would ask?*

If yes, you have shared understanding. Stop interviewing and produce the restate. If no, you're not done; ask the next question.

This is a checkable test, not a vibe. It also has a floor: if you've gone several rounds and still can't predict, that's information about the ask, not a reason to keep grinding. Stop and tell the user: "I've asked X questions and I still can't predict your reactions. Something foundational is missing. Want to step back?"

## Output

The output of this skill is a **confirmed statement of intent**: the restate from Step 4, with an explicit yes from Step 5. That's the deliverable. Specs, plans, and task lists are downstream; they consume the intent this skill produces.

If the user wants the intent to persist (a multi-session project, a handoff to another collaborator), offer to save it to `.claude/plans/intent-[topic].md`. Only save if they confirm.

## Downstream

`task-scope-and-spec` turns confirmed intent into testable requirements;
`planning-and-task-decomposition` orders them into a plan; `guided-implementation` (you
write the code) or `goal-workflow` (the agent does) executes it. Frame any handoff in terms
of the confirmed intent, never the original underspecified ask.

`codebase-research` is orthogonal — it finds where code lives, not what the user wants.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The ask is clear enough" | If you can't write the desired outcome in one sentence right now, it isn't. |
| "Questions waste their time" | Four to six questions is cheap. Building the wrong thing isn't, and they bear that cost. |
| "I'll figure it out as I build" | Discovery during implementation is rework at 10x the price. |
| "I should offer options instead" | Options work when they know what they want. They don't yet — asking narrows, listing widens. |
| "Attaching my guess leads them" | Leading is the point. The risk is sycophancy; mitigate by being willing to be wrong. |
| "We've talked enough" | Test it: can you predict their reaction to the next three questions? |

## Red Flags

- Three or more questions in a single message: that's batching, not interviewing
- A question without your hypothesis attached: that's surveying, not committing
- Accepting "whatever you think is best" as a terminal answer
- Producing a spec, plan, or task list before the user has explicitly confirmed your restate
- Questions framed as "what would be best practice?" instead of "what do you actually want?"
- The user gives a sophistication-signaling answer ("scalable", "clean", "modern") and you accept it without probing whether it's what they actually want
- Three or more rounds without your confidence visibly rising: you're asking the wrong questions, step back and reframe
- A confidence number below ~70% with no reason attached: the user can't help close the gap if they don't know what's missing
- Saving the intent doc before the user has confirmed (the doc itself implies a yes the user didn't give)
- Skipping the "Out of scope" line in the restate (silent disagreement about non-goals is half of misalignment)
